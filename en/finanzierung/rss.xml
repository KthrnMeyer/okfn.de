      <description>Most costs are linked to the implementation of projects and the organization of events. We try to keep fixed costs (non project-related expenditure) low. Rent, ancillary costs for the Berlin office and server expenses represent the majority of such costs.
 ** for example infrastructure, book keeping, insurances
We currently employ around 18.5 full-time equivalent staff.</description>
