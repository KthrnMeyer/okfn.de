      <description>Digitally networked technologies bring new opportunities for civil society: Citizens can exercise their rights more easily and obtain better information about what the government is doing.
We promote fact-based political discourse. We develop software, provide infrastructure and promote open source projects. We experiment and offer a field of experimentation for others.</description>

      <description>In a democratic state, open knowledge is a prerequisite for participation. We strive for a world in which knowledge is freely available both online and offline. We give talks, run initiatives, and research the effects of open data.
Our projects and campaigns actively demonstrate how open knowledge strengthens democracy.</description>
